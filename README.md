A brief synopsis on The Odin Project: For this project, The Odin Project gives basic instructions on what needs to be implemented but does not explain how. There is also a lot of area for flexibility in terms of style and specifics on how the program runs. The instructions to this project can be found at this link. https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator.
I have attached a .txt file with my research and planning for the project.   

The main goal of this project is to create a 4-function calculator using primarily Javascript but also HTML and CSS.

This project is still in progress, so the README.md page will be updated on or near completion.
