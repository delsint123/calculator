calculator

create basic operators functions
	add
		basic operand1 + operand2 
	subtract
		basic operand1 - operand2
	multiply
		basic operand1 * operand2
	divide
		basic operand1 / operand2
			conditional statement add error message for division by 0

create function operate()
	takes an operator and 2 numbers then calls function from above
		use conditional to decide which operator function to use
		round answers with long decimals
		operations should happen one at a time in order
			store result in reserved variable (for further calculation)
		after completion clear object
			copies results to operand1 and display variable to do more calculations

create HTML calculator 
	includes buttons for
		(all require addEventListener('click', () => {}) for buttons)
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent
		each digit, 
			set eventListener function to set values in an object (conditional statement)
		above functions, 
			set operator variable 
		equals, 
			only allow to operate if proper amount of numbers and operators are present
			runs operate()
		and clear
			clear needs to wipe out ALL existing data
				wipes all values in objects

	use display: grid to separate buttons
		grid-template-columns: repeat(#, auto)

	ec: add "." button for floats
		only allow 1 decimal point in a number
	
	ec: add backspace button
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30849912/backspace-on-calculator-using-javascript
		
	ec: add keyboard support
		using addEventListener('keydown', () => {})
			retrieve data keys for numbers, enter, backspace, delete (for clear), and operators 
				e.keyCode

	display for calculator
		create functions that populate display
			should store the "display value" in a variable
		update display with solution
			call operate()
